# Intro to Linux

## Key Concepts

- Root Directory (/): The top of the Linux file system, which everything branches from
- Absolute Paths: These full path starting from the root. Always beginS with '/' (e.g /home/user/docs)
- Relative Paths: The path relative to your current working directory/location. Common shortcuts include '.' (current/working directory) and '..' (Parent Directory)

Linux Commands are textual instructions that tell the OS what to do, they are:

- Case sensitive
- Have various options e.g. '-a' and arguments '.' that can modify their behaviour
- Have instructions via Manual

## Commands

- man: Provides manual to a particular command e.g man ls

- pwd: Prints the absolute path to see where you are in the file system

- ls: Lists the visible files and directories in your current location/folder e.g. Use relative path (ls Linux) when you're nearby or use absolute path (ls /home/user/Linux) when somewhere completely different in the system

- ls -a: Lists all files, including hidden 'dotfiles'

- mkdir: Creates a new directory, so mkdir hello would create the folder "hello"

- rmdir: Removes a directory. so rmdir hello would remove the folder "hello" (rmdir only applies to directories, rm would be used for a file)

- touch: Creates a file, so touch hello.txt would create the hello.txt file

- cat: Primarily used to read contents of a file but can also be used to create a new file

- mv: Used to move or rename files
